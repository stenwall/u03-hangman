# U03 Hangman

School Assignment @ Chas Academy, class FWD20

---

>This task is to individually implement a popular rudimentary game in JavaScript - "hang man". There will be a base code and structure which you can use as a starting point when solving the task.

>*Hang Man is a game where a word is randomly generated. The player then guesses which letters the word contains, for each incorrect answer a part of the "hang man" picture is drawn. If the player guesses wrong enough times and the man has been "hanged" and the player has lost. If, on the other hand, the player succeeds in guessing all the letters, the player wins.*

## Requirements

- [x] A working game in JavaScript that can be played on a web site
- [x] Working in different browsers and on different units (mobile and desktop)
- [x] Basic responsiveness
- [x] Buttons for all the letters
- [x] Visual representation of the hanged man (the process of the game)

The code should:

- [x] Follow defined standard
- [x] Have correct indentation
- [x] Not cause errors in execution
- [x] Be extensively commented (in code, markup and styling)

## Deployment

The site is deployed on Github Pages: [stenwall.github.io/u03-hangman-stenwall](https://stenwall.github.io/u03-hangman-stenwall/)
